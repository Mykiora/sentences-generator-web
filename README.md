# Sentences Generator

## How to use 
Not really hard to use. There is a settings box in the bottom of the page. Just select the options you want then click the "generate" button and experiment. Since it's randomized, it would be normal if you get a "nonsense sentence". You can modify sentences that are being generated by changing the words in the javascript. I think, if you make one or two little changes you could get the words from an API.
